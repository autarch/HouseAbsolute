   <h1 class="pad8">Areas of Expertise</h1>

   <ul>
    <li>
     <h2 class="pad8">Application Design and Development</h2>

     <p class="v12">
     If you want an application that doesn't cost twice as much to
     maintain as it did to build, you need to <i>design</i> that
     application.  I can help you turn your ideas into a concrete
     specification, and then build that application for you.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <h2 class="pad8">Perl</h2>
  
     <p class="v12">
     If you have an existing application in Perl that needs fixing, I
     can do that.  If you want a new application, I can do that too.
     </p>

     <p class="v12">
     I have developed and contributed to numerous Free Software/Open
     Source Perl tools, including <a
     href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a> and <a
     href="http://www.alzabo.org/">Alzabo</a>.  In fact, when it comes
     to Mason, I co-wrote <a href="http://www.masonbook.com/">the
     book</a> on it!
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <h2 class="pad8">Database Design</h2>

     <p class="v12">
     For data-dependent applications, nothing is more important than
     database design.  If your database design does not really reflect
     your business model, then all applications using that database
     will be forever crippled.  I can help you get it right the first
     time.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <h2 class="pad8">Refactoring, Redesigning, or Rewriting</h2>

     <p class="v12">
     Perhaps for a previous application you chose &quot;Super-Cheap
     Consulting Incorporated&quot;, and now you are feeling the pain.  I can
     help you fix it.
     </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <h2 class="pad8">Perl Training</h2>

     <p class="v12">
     Do you have an in-house team that needs Perl training?  I am a
     practiced public speaker, having given numerous presentations at
     conferences and user groups, and I have experience as a
     college-level lecturer.
