<h1>Dave Rolsky</h1>

<p>In the time I've been working as a developer, I've realized
that what I really like is to solve problems <em>for humans</em>.
This means more than just "making it go". When you're working
with people, you have to create a solution that works for them.
I'm no usability guru, but I want to build tools that people
enjoy using, rather than tools they use for lack of a better
alternative.</p>

<p>Good applications have both clean internals and usable
interfaces. That interface might be a web application, a command
line program, or a daemon, but usability is important in all
those cases.</p>

<p>I also have a great interest in data. Solid data
representation and handling is the key to building powerful,
flexible applications. "Garbage in, garbage out," and garbage
isn't useful.</p>

<p>Finally, I care about the development process. Automated
testing, good deployment tools, QA, bug tracking, source control;
all of these tools and practices are crucial to building software
that is good for both its users <em>and</em> its developers. It's
not enough to build something that works if you can't maintain it
over time. It's not enough to fix a bug if you reintroduce it in
the next release. Software should get better over time, not
worse.</p>

<p>I've spent most of time programming in Perl and JavaScript,
with a smattering of C. I also know SQL all too well.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<div class="experience-position">
  <div class="employer-and-dates">
    <h3 class="employer"><a href=
    "http://www.reuters.com/">Thomson Reuters</a></h3>

    <h3 class="dates">Consultant, 11/2007 - present</h3>
  </div>

  <p>At Thomson Reuters, I have worked on integrating new data
  feeds with an existing database of corporate information. Much
  of this work involved talking to the business side of the
  company, as well as the outside feed partner, and making sure
  that the solution I was building would satisfy our business
  requirements.</p>

  <p>I have also worked on a number of infrastructure projects. I
  worked on adding support for new processor architectures to our
  build system, building a mechanism for managing our Perl module
  installations, and adding support for handling Unicode data to
  our code base. This work required coordination with developers
  in different groups, as well as gaining an understanding of
  business requirements for internationalization.</p>

    <h3 class="dates">Senior Developer, 3/2007 - 11/2007</h3>
  </div>

  <p>At LiveText, I worked on a variety of projects. One project
  involved adding automatic draft saving to the FCK editor that
  was used to create documents in the system. As users edited,
  work was regularly saved to the server using Ajax. If a
  document was not saved "properly" by the user, perhaps because
  of a browser crash, they did not lose their work.</p>

  <p>I also helped improve internal practices by implementing
  automated unit and integration testing. I set up a continuous
  test server that checked out branches of the code, ran the
  tests, and reported the results to a <a href=
  "http://smolder.sf.net/">Smolder</a> instance.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As part of a growing startup, I worked on numerous projects
  at Socialtext. I created our first automated deployment system,
  as well as our first automated tests. I also performed on-site
  field engineering for a major customer, integrating our
  appliance into their custom SSL certificate authentication
  system.</p>

  <p>One of the larger projects I worked on was moving some of
  our data storage from the file system to a Postgres database,
  providing data integrity, increased query-ability, and much
  improved speed of data retrieval. Along the way, I also
  implemented a simple but flexible ACL system, and added real
  authorization checks, plugging numerous security holes.</p>

  <p>One of my first consulting jobs was with <a href=
  "http://www.marigoldtech.com/">Marigold Technologies</a>,
  working on their salesperson-focused CRM, <a href=
  "http://www.contactbook.net/">ContactBook</a>. I was initially
  hired to do code review of the existing system. After this was
  completed, I helped them re-architect the code for greater
  scalability and added a number of features. Along the way, I
  mentored another developer on the new system architecture.</p>

  <p>The most challenging of these new features was adding
  per-client custom fields for contacts. The end result was a
  customizable system for end users which maintained strong data
  integrity constraints and allowed for quick searches over large
  sets of contacts.</p>

  <p>I've also worked for <a href=
  "http://www.kineticode.com/">Kineticode</a> on deploying the
  <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a> CMS for
  several Kineticode customers.</p>

  <p>Later, I worked on a simple mini-CMS for <a href=
  "http://www.nativephilanthropy.org/">Native Americans in
  Philanthropy</a>. This CMS allowed them to control the dynamic
  portions of their web site, such as job listings and news. It
  is also integrated with a membership management CRM I wrote,
  allowing new members to sign up and pay online.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I was responsible for the design and development of an
  online system "donation shopping" system. Non-profit
  organizations were able to enter data about themselves, and
  this data was browseable by potential donors, who could donate
  directly to the non-profits.</p>

  <p>Clients were provided co-branded access to the system, and
  had an administrative interface from which they could view
  statistics, filter non-profits shown on their version of the
  site, and select featured projects for their site.</p>

  <p>In addition, I also created a development environment which
  allowed both the designers (using Macs) and developers (using
  either Windows or GNU/Linux) to share a CVS repository and to
  run their own copy of the site.</p>

<h2>Free Software</h2>

author.</p>

<h3>Moose</h3>

<p>I have been part of the <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose
core development team since early 2008, and have contributed a
variety of code to both</a> <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose">Moose</a> and <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-MOP">Class::MOP</a>. I have
also written a number of <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky">Moose extensions</a>.</p>

<h3>The Perl DateTime Project</h3>

<p>This is a project I began, and still lead, which has developed
a comprehensive suite of inter-operating Perl modules for dealing
with dates and times. Modules in the DateTime suite are listed on
the <a href="http://datetime.perl.org/">datetime.perl.org</a>
website.</p>

<h3>Mason</h3>

<p>Since 2000, I have been a member of the core team for the
<a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a> templating system. I
led the development effort for the 1.10 release of Mason, which
involved rewriting and re-architecting major portions of the
Mason code base, in order to make it more easily extensible.</p>

<h3>Log::Dispatch</h3>

<p><a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Log-Dispatch">Log::Dispatch</a>.
is a suite of object-oriented Perl modules for logging a message
to multiple outputs. It is widely used by Perl application
developers.</p>

<h3>Exception::Class</h3>

<p><a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Exception-Class">Exception::Class</a>
allows Perl developers to declare hierarchical sets of exception
classes for their own use. It provides a complete exception
object implementation though developers are also free to use
their own if they prefer to do so. In his book <em>Perl Best
Practices</em>, Damian Conway recommends this module as the best
way to declare exception classes in Perl.</p>

<h3>Params::Validate</h3>

<p><a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Params-Validate">Params::Validate</a>
provides method/function argument validation. It allows
verification based on primitive types, object class, object
interface, and callbacks. At a simpler level, it can be used to
verify that required parameters are present and that no
superfluous ones have been given.</p><a name="other" id=

<h2>Other Work</h2>

<p>These are some of the community projects I have worked on.</p>

<h3>VegGuide.org</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://www.vegguide.org/">online guide for
vegetarians</a>. This is a community-maintained directory of restaurants,
grocers, and more. Any registered user can rate/review entries, add new data,
and suggest changes to existing data.</p>

<h3>jobs.perl.org</h3>

<p>I collaborated with Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen on the development
of <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">the Perl jobs site</a>, which is a resource
for Perl developers and employers looking to hire them. The site uses Mason
and MySQL.</p>
