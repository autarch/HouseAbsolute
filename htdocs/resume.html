<h1>David Rolsky</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In the time I've been working as a developer, I've realized that what I really
like is to solve problems <em>for humans</em>. This means more than just
"making it go". When you're working with real people, that means making
something that they can use. I'm no usability guru, but I want to build tools
that people enjoy using, rather than tools they use for lack of a better
alternative.
</p>

<p>
I want to create applications with both clean internals and usable
interfaces. That interface might be a web application, a command line
program, or a daemon, but usability is important in all those cases.
</p>

<p>
I also have a great interest in data. A lot of developers are
interested in code, but it seems like fewer are interested in thinking
about data. Data representation and handling is the key to building
powerful, flexible applications. As the old saying goes, "garbage in,
garbage out."
</p>

<p>
Finally, I care about the development process. Automated testing, good
deployment tools, QA, bug tracking, source control; all of these tools
and practices are crucial to building software that is good for both
its users <em>and</em> its developers. It's not enough to build
something that works if you can't maintain it over time. It's not
enough to fix a bug if you reintroduce it in the next
release. Software should get better over time, not worse.
</p>

<p>
I've spent most of time programming in Perl and JavaScript, with a smattering
of C. I also know SQL all too well.

<h2>Experience</h2>


<div class="experience-position">

 <div class="employer-and-dates">
  <h3 class="employer"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Thomson Reuters</a></h3>
  <h3 class="dates">Consultant, 11/2007 - present</h3>
 </div>

 <p>
   At Thomson Reuters, I have worked on integrating new data feeds
   with an existing database of corporate information. Much of this
   work involved talking to the business side of the company, as well
   as the outside feed partner, and making sure that the solution I
   was building would satisfy our business requirements.
 </p>

 <p>
   On the technical side, this work involved building Perl scripts for
   batch jobs that were run via Autosys, and updating a complex Sybase
   database.
 </p>

  <h3 class="employer"><a href="http://www.livetext.com/">LiveText, Inc.</a></h3>
  <h3 class="dates">Senior Developer, 3/2007 - 11/2007</h3>
 </div>

 <p>
   At LiveText, I worked on a variety of projects. One project
   involved adding automatic draft saving to the FCK editor that was used to
   create documents in the system. As users edited, work was regularly
   saved to the server using Ajax. If a document was not saved
   "properly" by the user, perhaps because of a browser crash, they
   did not lose their work.
 </p>

 <p>
   I also helped improve internal practices by implementing automated unit and
   integration testing. I set up a continuous test server that checked out
   branches of the code, ran the tests, and reported the results to
   a <a href="http://smolder.sf.net/">Smolder</a> instance.
 </p>

  <h3 class="dates">Senior Developer - Database Lead, 9/2004 - 3/2007</h3>
 </div>

 <p>
  As part of a growing startup, I worked on numerous projects at
  Socialtext. I created our first automated deployment system, as well
  as our first automated tests. I also performed on-site field
  engineering for a major customer, integrating our appliance into
  their custom SSL certificate authentication system.
 </p>

 <p>
  One of the larger projects I worked on was to move some of our data
  storage from the filesystem to a Postgres database, providing data
  integrity, increased queryability, and much improved speed of data
  retrieval. Along the way, I also implemented a simple but flexible
  ACL system, and added real authorization checks, plugging numerous
  security holes.

 <p>
  One of my first consulting jobs was
  with <a href="http://www.marigoldtech.com/">Marigold
  Technologies</a>, working on their salesperson-focused
  CRM, <a href="http://www.contactbook.net/">ContactBook</a>. I was
  initially hired to do code review of the existing system. After this
  was completed, I helped them re-architect the code for greater
  scalability, and added a number of features. Along the way, I
  mentored another programmer on the new system architecture.
 </p>

 <p>
  The most challenging of these new features was adding per-client
  custom fields for contacts. The end result was customizable system
  for end users, while still maintaining strong data integrity
  constraints and allowing for quick searches over large sets of
  contacts.
 </p>

 <p>
  I've also worked
  for <a href="http://www.kineticode.com/">Kineticode</a> setting up
  the <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a> CMS for several
  Kineticode customers.
 </p>

 <p>
  Later , I worked on a simple mini-CMS
  for <a href="http://www.nativephilanthropy.org/">Native Americans in
  Philanthropy</a>. This CMS allows them to control the dynamic
  portions of their web site, such as job listings and news. It is
  also integrated with a membership management CRM I wrote, allowing
  new members to sign up and pay online.

 </div>

 <p>
  I was responsible for the design and development of an online system
  "donation shopping" system. Non-profit organizations were able to
  enter data about themselves, and data was browseable by potential
  donors, who could donate directly to the non-profits.
 </p>

 <p>
  Clients were provided co-branded access to the system, and had an
  administrative interface from which they could view statistics,
  filter non-profits shown on their version of the site, and select
  featured projects for their site.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition, I also created a development environment which allowed
  both the designers (using Macs) and developers (using either
  Windows or GNU/Linux) to share a CVS repository and to run their own
  copy of the site.
 </p>

 <p>
  The site was mostly created using Mason, with a little PHP (not my
  work), and MySQL as the database. My data modeling tool Alzabo was
  used in the development of the schema for the application, as well
  as for communicating with the database.

  <h3 class="dates">Consultant, 7/24/2000 - 2/23/2001</h3>
 </div>

 <p>
  I was involved in the design and implementation of a Unix version of
  O'Reilly's WebBoard, which had begun life as a VB web application
  for Windows. This was not a port in a strict sense, as the "ported"
  version was in Perl. In addition, many new features were added to
  this version which were never present in the Windows version.
 </p>

 <p>
  The ported application used Apache and mod_perl as its platform,
  along with a database back end capable of using any one of four
  databases, MySQL, Postgres, Sybase, or Oracle.
 </p>

 <p>
  There were a number of challenges while working on this application,
  including creating an installer that would seamlessly use an
  existing Apache/mod_perl installation or install these components
  from scratch. The installer also had to handle installing the
  software on the file system and creating the schema for the chosen
  DBMS. I also worked on the DBMS communication layer in order to
  minimize duplicated code, taking the original Sybase code and
  reworking it to support all four platforms. This product also
  supported multiple authentication models, a very full featured and
  customizable interface, and a powerful web interface for
  administration.

 <p>
  As part of a three person team, I participated in rewriting a highly
  dynamic web site from scratch. This included redesigning the
  database and rewriting the code to run under mod_perl. The final
  result was much faster, more maintainable and more extensible. It
  also allowed for greater depth of reporting, as the new design was
  capable of storing more information on site traffic and how the site
  was being used.

  different projects, including the development of a simple webapp
  call tracking system for Customer Service, programs for exchanging
  data between Digital River and its clients, and a webapp providing a
  real-time interface for clients and partners.
 </p>

 <p>
  From June of 1999 onwards, I was responsible for the maintenance and
  refinement of all shared Perl code used by my team. In addition, I
  was the primary interface with other development teams, responsible
  for the architecture of all new projects, code reviews, and
  mentoring other programmers.

<h2>Free Software</h2>

<p>
Besides contributing patches to numerous projects, I have created
and/or maintained a number of Free Software projects, and I am a
prolific <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/DROLSKY">CPAN</a>
and <a href="http://www.openjsan.org/doc/a/au/autarch/">JSAN</a>
module author.
</p>

<h3>Moose</h3>

<p>
 I have been part of the <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose core
 development team since early 2008, and have contributed a variety of
 code to both <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose">Moose</a>,
 and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-MOP">Class::MOP</a>. I
 have also written a number
 of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky">Moose extensions</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Perl DateTime Project</h3>

<p>
 This is a project I began, and still lead, which aims to develop a
 comprehensive suite of inter-operating Perl modules for dealing with
 dates and times. Modules in the DateTime suite are listed on
 the <a href="http://datetime.perl.org/">datetime.perl.org</a>
 website.
</p>

<h3>Mason</h3>

<p>
 Since 2000, I have been a member of the core team for
 the <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a> templating system. I
 led the development effort for the 1.10 release of Mason, which
 involved rewriting and re-architecting major portions of the Mason
 code base, in order to make it more easily extensible.
</p>

<h3>Log::Dispatch</h3>

<p>
 <a
 href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Log-Dispatch">Log::Dispatch</a>.
 is a suite of object-oriented Perl modules for logging a message to
 multiple outputs. It is being used in a number of other modules,
 including Log4Perl and Log::Dispatch::Config, and is widely used by
 Perl application developers.
</p>

<h3>Exception::Class</h3>

<p>
 <a
 href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Exception-Class">Exception::Class</a>
 allows Perl programmers to declare hierarchical sets of exception
 classes for their own use. It provides a complete exception object
 implementation though programmers are also free to use their own if
 they prefer to do so. In his book <em>Perl Best Practices</em>,
 Damian Conway recommends this module as the best way to declare
 exception classes in Perl.
</p>

<h3>Params::Validate</h3>

<p>
 <a
 href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Params-Validate">Params::Validate</a>
 provides method/function argument validation. It allows verification
 based on primitive types, object class, object interface, and
 callbacks. At a simpler level, it can be used to verify that
 required parameters are present and that no superfluous ones have
 been given.
</p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2>Other Work</h2>

<p>
These are some of the community projects I have worked on.
</p>

<p>
 An <a href="http://www.vegguide.org/">online guide for
 vegetarians</a>. It is designed to be community-maintained, so that
 any registered user can rate/review entries, add new data, and
 suggest changes to existing data.
</p>

<h3>jobs.perl.org</h3>

<p>
 I collaborated with Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen on the development
 of <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">the Perl jobs site</a>, which is a
 resource for Perl programmers and employers looking to hire them. The
 site uses Mason and MySQL.
