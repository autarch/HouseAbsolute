   I was responsible for the design and development of an online
   system into which non-profit organizations were able to enter data
   about themselves.  This data was browse-able by potential donors, who
   could donate directly to the non-profits via a shopping cart.
   </p>

   <p class="v12">
   Clients were provided co-branded access to the system, and had an
   administrative interface from which they could view statistics, filter
   non-profits shown on their version of the site, and select featured
   projects for their site.
   </p>

   <p class="v12">
   In addition, I also created a development environment which allowed
   both the designers (using Macintoshes) and developers (using either
   Windows or GNU/Linux) to share a CVS repository and to run their
   own copy of the site.
   </p>

   <p class="v12">
   The site uses Mason, MySQL, and some PHP.  In addition, my data
   modeling tool Alzabo has been used in the development of the
   schema for the application, as well as for communicating with the
   database.

   I was involved in the design and implementation of a Unix version
   of O'Reilly's WebBoard, which at the time was solely a
   Windows-based product.  This was not a port in a strict sense, as
   the "ported" version was in Perl, while the original was in Visual
   Basic.  In addition, many new features were added to this version
   which were never present in the Windows version.
   </p>

   <p class="v12">
   The ported application used Apache and mod_perl as its platform,
   along with a database back end capable of using any one of four
   databases, MySQL, Postgres, Sybase, or Oracle, as a back end.
   </p>

   <p class="v12">
   There were a number of challenges while working on this
   application, including creating an installer that would seamlessly
   use an existing Apache and mod_perl installation, or create a new
   one.  The installer also had to handle installing the software on
   the file system and in the chosen database.  I also worked on the
   database communication layer in order to minimize duplicated code,
   taking the original Sybase code and reworking it to support all
   four platforms.  This product also supported multiple
   authentication models, a very full featured and customizable
   interface, and a powerful web interface for administration.

   As part of a three person team, I participated in rewriting a

   final result was much faster, more maintainable and more
